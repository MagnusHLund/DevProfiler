# DevProfiler
DevProfiler is a WordPress plugin, which aids in figuring out which processes take a long time.
This is accomplished by listening to the hook education times.

There is also a manual profiling option, which allows you to put flags anywhere in the code.
This can be used to see when a function or multiple functions are done executing, from a start and end points.
There are also optional checkpoints, which can be placed between the start and end points.
